# Memory in AI Agents

## Overview

Memory in AI agents serves as the bridge between raw computational power and meaningful, contextual interactions. Unlike traditional software that relies on databases or caches, agent memory systems are designed to mimic aspects of human memory, allowing agents to maintain context, learn from experiences, and make informed decisions.

## Types of Memory

### Working Memory (Short-Term)

Working memory is the agent's immediate consciousness - the information it's actively processing. Think of it like your mental workspace when solving a problem. In AI agents, this typically includes:

- The current conversation or task context
- Recently accessed information
- Temporary calculations or reasoning steps

Working memory is limited by the LLM's context window (typically between 4K to 32K tokens), which creates the need for efficient memory management strategies.

### Semantic Memory (Knowledge)

Semantic memory stores factual knowledge and understanding. This is where agents keep their "knowledge of the world," including:

- Domain-specific information
- Learned concepts and relationships
- Reference materials and documentation
- Organizational knowledge

In practice, semantic memory is often implemented through vector stores and retrieval systems. Here's a simplified version of HIVE's semantic memory implementation:

```python
class SemanticMemory(BaseMemoryType):
    def generate_with_autogen(self) -> Memory:
        """Initialize the vector store for semantic memory."""
        return ChromaDBVectorMemory(config=PersistentChromaDBVectorMemoryConfig(
            collection_name=self.name,
            persistence_path="./chroma_db",
            k=2,  # Number of results to retrieve
            score_threshold=0.4,  # Minimum similarity score
        ))
    
    async def load_with_langchain(self, content: List[str], verbose: bool = False):
        """Process and store content with intelligent chunking."""
        chunker = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
            chunk_size=1000,  # Characters per chunk
            chunk_overlap=200,  # Overlap between chunks
            length_function=len,
        )

        for source in content:
            chunks = chunker.split_text(source)
            for chunk in chunks:
                await self.memory.add(MemoryContent(
                    content=chunk,
                    mime_type=MemoryMimeType.TEXT,
                    metadata={"source": source}
                ))
```

This implementation showcases several key concepts:

1. **Vector Store Integration**: Using ChromaDB for efficient similarity search
2. **Intelligent Chunking**: Breaking content into manageable pieces while preserving context
3. **Metadata Tracking**: Maintaining source information for retrieved content
4. **Configurable Retrieval**: Adjustable parameters for precision vs. recall

### Episodic Memory (Experience)

Episodic memory captures the agent's experiences and interactions. This includes:

- Past conversations and outcomes
- User preferences and behaviors
- Problem-solving attempts (both successful and failed)
- Temporal sequences of events

This type of memory enables agents to learn from experience and maintain consistency across interactions.

### Procedural Memory (Skills)

Procedural memory stores the "how-to" knowledge - the methods and procedures for completing tasks. This includes:

- Workflow patterns
- Standard operating procedures
- Learned optimization strategies
- Tool usage patterns

## Memory Management Techniques

### Chunking

Chunking is a fundamental technique for managing large amounts of information in AI systems. It's similar to how humans break down phone numbers into smaller groups of digits for easier recall.

**Purpose and Benefits:**
1. Manages context window limitations
2. Improves information retrieval accuracy
3. Enables efficient processing of large documents
4. Maintains semantic coherence

**Types of Chunking:**

1. **Token-based Chunking**
   - Splits content based on token count
   - Best for: Working with specific LLM context windows
   - Challenge: May break semantic units

2. **Semantic Chunking**
   - Splits content based on meaning
   - Best for: Maintaining context and coherence
   - Challenge: More complex to implement

3. **Structural Chunking**
   - Uses document structure (paragraphs, sections)
   - Best for: Formatted documents, code, documentation
   - Challenge: Requires consistent document structure

Here's a simple example of how chunking works in practice:

```python
class SemanticChunker:
    def chunk_document(self, document: str, chunk_size: int = 512):
        """
        Chunks a document while preserving semantic meaning.
        Demonstrates basic chunking principles.
        """
        paragraphs = document.split('\n\n')
        chunks = []
        current_chunk = []
        
        for paragraph in paragraphs:
            if self._chunk_size(current_chunk + [paragraph]) <= chunk_size:
                current_chunk.append(paragraph)
            else:
                chunks.append('\n\n'.join(current_chunk))
                current_chunk = [paragraph]
                
        return chunks
```

### Memory Compression

Memory compression helps manage large amounts of information efficiently. Unlike traditional data compression, AI memory compression focuses on preserving semantic meaning while reducing token usage.

**Compression Strategies:**

1. **Summarization**
   - Creates concise versions of longer content
   - Preserves key information and context
   - Useful for long-term storage

2. **Information Distillation**
   - Extracts essential concepts and relationships
   - Removes redundant or less important details
   - Maintains core meaning

3. **Progressive Compression**
   - More aggressive compression for older memories
   - Maintains detailed recent information
   - Balances storage and accessibility

### Memory Retrieval

Effective memory retrieval is crucial for agent performance. The goal is to surface relevant information when needed without overwhelming the agent's working memory.

In HIVE, memory retrieval is built into the base memory system:

```python
class BaseMemoryType(ABC):
    async def index_from_source(self, content: List[str] = None):
        """Index content from various sources."""
        source_type = self.config.get("source_type", "content")
        source = self.config.get("source", content)
        
        if source_type == "directory":
            await self._index_directory(source)
        elif source_type == "files":
            await self._index_documents(source)
        elif source_type == "content":
            await self.load_with_langchain(source)
    
    async def _index_documents(self, sources: List[str]):
        """Process different document types."""
        for source in sources:
            if source.endswith(".pdf"):
                pages = PyPDFLoader(source).load()
                await self.load_with_langchain([pages])
            else:
                with open(source, "r") as f:
                    await self.load_with_langchain([f.read()])
```

This implementation demonstrates:
1. **Flexible Source Handling**: Support for directories, files, or raw content
2. **Document Type Support**: Built-in handling for PDFs and text files
3. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add support for new document types

## Best Practices
