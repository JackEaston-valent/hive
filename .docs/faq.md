# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## Getting Started

### How do I know if HIVE is right for my project?
HIVE is ideal for projects that need:
- Complex multi-agent interactions
- Long-term memory and learning
- Structured workflows
- Reliable production deployment

If you only need simple one-off agent interactions, a lighter framework might be more appropriate.

### What are the system requirements?
HIVE is designed to run on standard hardware, but consider:
- Minimum 8GB RAM for development
- 16GB+ RAM recommended for production
- SSD storage for memory persistence
- Stable internet connection for API calls

### How much does it cost to run HIVE?
Costs depend primarily on:
1. LLM API usage (varies by provider)
2. Number of concurrent agents
3. Memory storage requirements
4. Infrastructure costs

We recommend starting with a small pilot to gauge costs for your specific use case.

## Common Issues

### Why are my agents giving inconsistent responses?
Common causes include:
1. Temperature settings too high
2. Insufficient context in prompts
3. Memory not properly configured
4. Competing instructions

Try reducing temperature and reviewing agent instructions for clarity.

### What should I do if memory usage grows too large?
Implement these strategies:
1. Configure memory pruning thresholds
2. Use appropriate chunking settings
3. Implement regular cleanup jobs
4. Monitor memory metrics

### How do I handle API outages?
HIVE provides several resilience features:
1. Automatic retries with backoff
2. Provider failover options
3. Local fallback capabilities
4. Queue management

Configure these in your agent settings based on your reliability needs.

## Best Practices

### How can I optimize costs?
Key strategies include:
1. Use appropriate model tiers
2. Implement caching
3. Optimize prompt length
4. Configure memory pruning
5. Monitor usage patterns

### What's the recommended development workflow?
1. Start with simple agents
2. Test interactions locally
3. Add memory gradually
4. Scale complexity
5. Monitor and optimize
