# HIVE Agentic Orchestration Methods

## Overview

Orchestration in HIVE provides patterns and methods for coordinating multiple AI agents to solve complex tasks. Built on top of AutoGen's foundation, HIVE orchestration focuses on creating reliable, maintainable, and efficient multi-agent systems.

## Core Concepts

### Pipeline Pattern

The primary orchestration pattern in HIVE is the Pipeline, which allows you to create structured workflows of agents. A pipeline:
- Inherits from `BaseChatAgent`
- Defines a workflow through a directed graph
- Manages message flow between agents
- Supports streaming execution

For example, to create a research pipeline:

```python
class ResearchPipeline(Pipeline):
    def build(self, researcher, analyst, writer):
        # Build a simple sequential pipeline:
        # researcher -> analyst -> writer
        builder = DiGraphBuilder()
        
        # Add agents and connections
        builder.add_node(researcher).add_node(analyst).add_node(writer)
        builder.add_edge(researcher, analyst)
        builder.add_edge(analyst, writer)
        
        # Create the executable pipeline
        self._setup_pipeline(builder)
```

### Message Flow Control

HIVE provides tools to manage how messages flow between agents:

1. **Message Filtering**: Control what messages each agent sees
2. **Context Management**: Maintain relevant conversation history
3. **Information Flow**: Direct output from one agent to specific other agents

Example of controlling message flow:

```python
class CodeReviewPipeline(Pipeline):
    def build(self, developer, reviewer1, reviewer2, integrator):
        # Create a parallel review process where:
        # - Two reviewers see only the latest code from developer
        # - Integrator sees all review comments
        builder = DiGraphBuilder()
        
        # Set up parallel review structure
        self._setup_review_flow(builder, developer, [reviewer1, reviewer2], integrator)
```

## Common Workflow Patterns

### 1. Sequential Processing

Best for tasks that need to happen in a specific order:
- Research → Analysis → Writing
- Planning → Development → Testing
- Data Collection → Processing → Visualization

Example use case - Document Creation:
```python
class DocumentPipeline(Pipeline):
    def build(self, researcher, writer, editor):
        # Create a linear workflow for document creation
        self._create_linear_flow([researcher, writer, editor])
```

### 2. Parallel Processing

Useful for tasks that can be done simultaneously:
- Multiple code reviewers
- Parallel data processing
- Concurrent analysis

Example use case - Multi-Aspect Analysis:
```python
class AnalysisPipeline(Pipeline):
    def build(self, coordinator, technical, financial, market, synthesizer):
        # Create parallel analysis streams that feed into final synthesis
        self._create_parallel_analysis_flow(
            coordinator=coordinator,
            analysts=[technical, financial, market],
            synthesizer=synthesizer
        )
```

### 3. Feedback Loops

For iterative improvement processes:
- Code review and revision
- Content editing
- Design refinement

Example use case - Content Refinement:
```python
class ContentRefinementPipeline(Pipeline):
    def build(self, writer, editor):
        # Create an iterative improvement loop between writer and editor
        self._create_feedback_loop(creator=writer, reviewer=editor)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Message Flow Control**
   - Filter messages to prevent information overload
   - Maintain clear communication paths
   - Consider message relevance for each agent

2. **Graph Structure**
   - Keep workflows as simple as possible
   - Use clear entry and exit points
   - Consider message volume at each node

3. **Error Handling**
   - Plan for agent failures
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Have fallback strategies

4. **Performance**
   - Balance parallel vs sequential processing
   - Monitor agent response times
   - Optimize message filtering

## Common Challenges and Solutions

1. **Message Overload**
   - Challenge: Agents receiving too much context
   - Solution: Implement appropriate message filters
   - Example: Only pass relevant messages to each agent

2. **Workflow Deadlocks**
   - Challenge: Agents waiting for each other
   - Solution: Design clear workflow paths
   - Example: Use timeouts and circuit breakers

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Challenge: Handling agent failures
   - Solution: Implement robust error handling
   - Example: Retry logic and fallback paths

## Next Steps

1. Review the Pipeline base class in HIVE
2. Experiment with different workflow structures
3. Learn about message filtering options
4. Study advanced orchestration patterns

Remember: The goal of orchestration is to create efficient, reliable workflows that make the best use of each agent's capabilities while maintaining clear communication paths and error handling.
